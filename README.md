# William Sonoma Sample Web Page

## Installation

Simply place the files on a live server or use WAMP/LAMP/MAMP to emulate a web server.

This is a very straight forward implementation. It's an HTML page with BootStrap that uses JavaScript to parse and output the JSON data.  

I deployed this to a Digital Ocean droplet, to see this page live on the server please go to the following URL:
